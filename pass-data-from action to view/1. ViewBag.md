# ViewBag
- Dynamic object
- Pass value from Action to View
- Creates properties in runtime
- **E+xist only for the `current http request`**
- One way communication tool
- The data can be used in that `View` which is connected to that Action.

## Example : 
- Suppose we have a `Student` Controller and an `Add` Action method.
- `StudentController.cs`
```csharp
 public ActionResult Add()
 {
     ViewBag.Id = 1; 
     ViewBag.Name = "Md. Habibur Rahman Munna";
     // create Id and Name  property in run time
     return View();
 }
```
- Access the data in `Add.cshtml` in View :
- We will get the object into `Model` oobject
- `Add.cshtml`
```Add.cshtml
<h2>@ViewBag.Id</h2>
<h2>@ViewBag.Name</h2>
```

## **E+xist only for the `current http request`** :
- Soppose I have an `A` and `B` Action method within same controller.
`A.cs`
```cs
 public ActionResult A()
 {
     ViewBag.Title = "A";  
     return View();
 }
```
`B.cs`
```cs
 public ActionResult B()
 {
     ViewBag.Title = "B";  
     return View();
 }
```
### When we request for `ControllerName/A`
- In view :
`A.cshtml`
```cshtml
<h1>@ViewBag.title</h1> ans : A
```

`B.cshtml`
```cshtml
<h1>@ViewBag.title</h1> // ans : B
```
## value is assigned for current request.
- When we Request for A action mehtod -> the value for title will A
- When we Request for B action mehtod -> the value for title will B
