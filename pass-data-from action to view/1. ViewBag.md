# ViewBag
- Dynamic object
- Pass value from Action to View
- Creates properties in runtime
- **E+xist only for the `current http request`**
- One way communication tool
- The data can be used in that `View` which is connected to that Action.

## Example : 
-Suppose we have a `Student` Controller and an `Add` Action method.
```csharp
StudentController.cs
 public ActionResult Add()
 {
     ViewBag.Id = 1; 
     ViewBag.Name = "Md. Habibur Rahman Munna";
     // create Id and Name  property in run time
     return View();
 }
```
- Access the data in `Add.cshtml` in View :
- We will get the object into `Model` oobject
```Add.cshtml
Add.cshtml
<h2>@ViewBag.Id</h2>
<h2>@ViewBag.Name</h2>
```
