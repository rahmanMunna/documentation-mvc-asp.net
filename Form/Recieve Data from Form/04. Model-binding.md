# 04. Model Binding : 
- Need a class
- In `Model`
```.cs
User.cs

public class User
{

}

```
- The Class Properties name must be same as the form name attribute.
- In `View`
```.cshtml
Create.cshtml

<input name="Name"/>
<input name="UserName"/>
<input name="Id"/>
```
- In `Model`
```.cs
User.cs

public class User
{
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public string UserName { get; set; }
  public string  Id { get; set; }
}

```
- Submitting action must recieve an object  of that class
- In `Controller`
```.cs
UserContoller.cs

public ActionResult Create(User user)
{
    //access
    user.Name;
    user.Id;
    user.UserName;
}


```

## How does this works :
- When submit the form,
  - An object is created of that `class` which class object has been `recieved` by `action methode`
    - `public ActionResult Create(User user)`
    - Here `User` class will be created after submit form
  - After Creating object, Properties of that class will be mapped with the matching name atrribute of the input tag.
    - `<input name="Name"/>` âž¡ `public string Name { get; set; }`
  - Then http parameter will be matched with the properties and set the value which does match.
